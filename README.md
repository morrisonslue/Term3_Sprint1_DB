# Conference Event Management - Midterm Sprint
This repository provides the **base template** for your **Midterm Sprint - Individual** project. You will be designing a PostgreSQL database and building a CLI application to interact with it.

For full project details, requirements, and grading criteria, refer to the [assignment sheet](https://menglishca.github.io/keyin-course-notes/databases/sprints/midterm/).


## Key Features
- **SQL Queries Folder (`sql-queries/`)**:
  - Place all **table creation, sample data insertion, and retrieval queries** in this folder.
  - Add your **3NF explanation** here as well.
  - The following placeholder files have been included to help structure your work, if you wish to use them:
    - `create-tables.sql` – Suggested file for **table creation queries**.
    - `insert-data.sql` – Suggested file for **sample data insertion queries**.
    - `queries.sql` – Suggested file for **queries to retrieve information**.
    - `normalization-explanation.txt` – Suggested file for your **3NF explanation**.
  - **These files are optional** and can be removed or reorganized as needed.
- **CLI Application (`cli-app/`)**:
  - This folder contains a **skeleton/template** for your CLI application.
  - The required features and functionality are outlined in the [assignment sheet](https://menglishca.github.io/keyin-course-notes/databases/sprints/midterm/)

## Getting Started (CLI App)
Follow these steps to set up and run the **CLI application**:

1. **Accept the GitHub Assignment** (link provided in the project sheet).
2. **Clone Your Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-new-repo-url>
   cd <your-new-repo-name>
   ```
3. **Navigate into the CLI App Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd cli-app
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Run the CLI Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The CLI app will execute commands against your PostgreSQL database.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Ensure your application runs without errors.**
- **All required SQL files and explanations must be in the `sql-queries/` folder.**
- **Push your completed work to GitHub** before the deadline.
- **Submit your repository link on Teams** under the appropriate assignment.

For any questions, refer to the [assignment sheet](https://menglishca.github.io/keyin-course-notes/databases/sprints/midterm/) or ask on Teams!

Happy coding and good luck!
